Hey, Let's talk about cloud computing.

Cloud computing is awesome, but also hard to understand. It profoundly changed the way we design, build and ship software applications.

From monolithic applications hosted on manually managed servers, we now have the possibility to scale to millions of users in seconds.

Cloud computing is made of new software pieces like API gateways, object storage, serverless and new practices like chaos engineering or increased observability.

Redefined.cloud serves as a getting started guide/entreypoint to the world of Cloud computing.
