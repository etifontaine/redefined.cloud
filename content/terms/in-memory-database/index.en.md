An in-memory database is a database where data is stored in the memory of computers, as opposed to traditional databases which use SSDs or hard drives.

In-memory databases can be [Non-relational databases](#non-relational-database 'What is a Non-relational database?') or [Relational databases](#relational-database 'What is a Relational database?').

## Best when speed and availability is key

This type of database is particularly useful when dealing with data that need to be accessed in real-time or really quickly: think of gaming platforms, real-time biding or embedded software systems. However, it comes at a price: by default, data stored in in-memory databases is not persistent and can be lost in case of crash.

## Benefits of using In-memory databases

- Latency & response time

## Use cases for In-memory databases

- Caching layer for persistent databases
- Real-time applications (Gaming, Banking, Biding)
- Embedded software systems

## Examples of In-memory databases

- [Memcached](https://memcached.org/)
- [Redis](https://redis.io/)
- [Apache Ignite](https://ignite.apache.org/)
