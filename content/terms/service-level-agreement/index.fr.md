SLA stands for Service Level Agreement. It is a legal document that defines a commitment a company makes to its customers. This type of contracts may contain several [SLO](#service-level-objective 'What is a Service level objective?'). If they are not met, the contract is broken and the company might have to give back money to its customers.

For example, AWS had to give free cloud credits to its impacted customers during [an outage which caused disruption on its EC2 & RDS services](https://aws.amazon.com/message/65648/). Indeed, in [their SLA](https://aws.amazon.com/compute/sla/), they say that they have a monthly uptime percentage of 99.99%, which means they make sure their services can only be down for 4.38 minutes per month.

When working with cloud providers, making sure you sign an SLA is important. Indeed, in case your product is a vital part of your customers's life, if your cloud provider goes down, so do you, which can cause you millions of dollars.
