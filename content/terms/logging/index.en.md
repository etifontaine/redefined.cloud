Logging is like writing down in a notebook each time you complete a task in your day. In the end, you have a log file, your notebook, which you can then come back to if you need to clarify something (a task you forgot or didn't complete entirely) or create statistics (on average, how many tasks do you complete each day).

Logging can often be confused with monitoring, tracing or profiling.

In the cloud and in software development, anything can be subject to logging: http requests metadata coming in (IP address, endpoint, duration, etc), database access (security control) and more. Logging can help you detect issues (anormal logs) and troubleshoot bugs by giving you context.

On the other end, it can be tempting to log everything happening in your services and apps so you can save and look back at everything happened. However, this strategy can be really expensive and ineffective (finding a needle in a haystack).

## Benefits of logging

- Monitor how your app is doing
- Troubleshoot bugs when they happen with some context
