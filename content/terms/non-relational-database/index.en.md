A non-relational database (or NoSQL database) as opposed to relational databases, is a type of database where data and relationships are represented in documents, key-value pairs or graphs.

Instead of having each piece of data stored in a table in a row like Google Sheet or Microsoft Excel, we represent them as unstructured shapes like Google Doc or Microsoft Word. This way, every document can have its own structure (titles, texts, numbers, etc.).

This type of database is particularly useful when dealing with data that doesn't have explicit schema (IoT events, Big Data, etc.).

## Advantages of NoSQL databases

- Flexibility
- Scalability

Important NoSQL databases are MongoDB (document-based), Neo4j (graph-based), Redis (key-value pair based) or DynamoDB.
