SLO stands for service level objective. These objectives make a huge part of [Service Level Agreements (SLA)](#service-level-agreement 'What is a Service level agreement?') between cloud providers and their customers. They are usually metrics like availability, response time or latency.

For example, one SLO of a cloud computing service might be that over a month, 99.9% of object storage PUT requests will complete in less than a second.
