In the context of Cloud computing, provisioning defines how you set up new servers, services ans networks. It can be done in multiple ways:

- Manually: engineers use a UI or CLI to manually set up infrastructure as needed
- Semi-automated: engineers use a mix of UI/CLI and scripts to set up infrastructure
- Automated: Infrastructure is defined as code and can be deployed/used on-demand without human intervention

While it is really easy to set up an EC2 instance for a blog, it can be harder as teams grow and your application becomes more complex. Using tools like Terrafom or Ansible can simplify how systems are deployed and managed.
