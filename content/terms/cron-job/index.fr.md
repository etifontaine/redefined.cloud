Cron jobs are a way to schedule code to run automatically at predetermined intervals. It helps automate repetitive work to be done at specific times.

They are made of:

- Cron expression: defines the interval at which we need to run the command
- Command: code to execute

## Use cases for cron jobs

- Backups to run each months
- Analytics exports to run each days
- Integration test to run each hours
